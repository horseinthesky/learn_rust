# Stage 3

**Connecting endpoints with DAOs**

Now that both endpoints and DAOs are created, it's time to connect these two major components so that we can return real data from our API!

## Steps

### Step 1

**Creating inner handlers**

A new file(and module) called `handlers_inner.rs` has been created in the `handlers` folder. This is where our framework agnostic handlers are defined. These handlers will do the "real work" of interacting with the DAOs. The outer handlers will eventually just call the inner handlers, passing in the appropriate inputs. The benefit of having framework agnostic handlers is that we can more easily change the web framework we are using!

Inside `handlers_inner.rs` you will notice a custom error type called `HandlerError`. For simplicity the inner handlers will only differentiate between two error types, a bad request error which means the user gave us improper inputs, or an internal error, which encapsulates every other error. A function called `default_internal_error` is also defined for convenience.

Complete this step by finishing the TODO items in `handlers_inner.rs`.

### Step 2

**Connection DAOs to Rocket state**

Now that the inner handlers are complete, it's time to setup our DAO instances and hook them up to Rocket. This will allow Rocket to inject our DAO instances into the outer handlers.

Complete this step by finishing the TODO items in `main.rs` and `handlers/mod.rs`.

### Step 3

**Updating outer handlers to use inner handlers**

The final step is to update the outer handlers to use the inner handlers instead of returning fake data. We will also add error handling to the outer handlers.

Inside `handlers/mod.rs` a custom error type called `APIError` has been added. This error type implements `Responder` which will allow us to return it from outer handlers. Additionally, each variant has an associated HTTP status code.

Not that `APIError` is very similar to `HandlerError` inside `handlers_inner.rs`. The only difference is `APIError` is coupled to the Rocket framework. For convenience, `APIError` implements the `From` trait for `HandlerError` which means you can easily convert an `HandlerError` instance into a `APIError` instance.

Complete this step by finishing the TODO items in `handlers/mod.rs`.

## Building & Testing

Now you can run your server using `cargo run` or cargo watch

```shell
 $ cargo watch -q -c -w src/ -x run
```

And test the endpoints using [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL):

Create question

```text
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/question \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"title": "Title",
	"description": "Description"
}'
```

Get questions

```text
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:8000/questions \
  --header 'Accept: application/json'
```

Delete question

```text
curl --request DELETE \
  --url http://localhost:8000/question \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"question_uuid": "[UUID of a created question]"
}'
```

Create answer

```text
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/answer \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"question_uuid": "[UUID of a created question]",
	"content": "Content"
}'
```

Get answers

```text
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:8000/answers \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"question_uuid": "[UUID of a created question]"
}'
```

Delete answer

```text
curl --request DELETE \
  --url http://localhost:8000/answer \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"answer_uuid": "[UUID of a created answer]"
}'
```

**NOTE:** If things are not working as expected, compare your code against the `Solution` folder.

## Final Note

Congratulations! You have built fully functioning API!

You should be proud of your progress if you've gotten this far.

Showcase your implementation and struggles you've faced along the way to others in the Let's Get Rusty community.

More importantly, teaching is the best way to learn. Any questions posted by others in the Discord channels are opportunities for you to answer and truly internalize your knowledge.
