# Stage 3

**Navigation and Program Loop**

Now that the database and UI are complete, it's time to build the bridge between them. In this step we will be building the navigator and program loop.

The navigator will handle navigating between pages, responding to actions returned from `handle_input()` on Page objects, and displaying prompts.

The program loop is responsible for running our application and continuously asking for user input until the user exits the program.

## Steps

### Step 1

**Implementing The Navigator**

A new file called `navigator.rs` has been added. Inside this file a `Navigator` Struct is defined, which contains 3 fields.

`pages` is a vector of `Page` objects. This vector is used for navigation. The user starts off on the home page and if they navigate to the Epic details page (for example) a new instance of `EpicDetail` will be created and pushed onto the pages vector. To navigate back to the home page we will simply pop the `EpicDetail` page off the pages vector (which acts like a stack). Note that the current page is always the last element in the `pages` vector.

`prompts` is an instance of the `Prompts` Struct. Look at the navigator tests to see how we can mock colures in the prompts Struct.

`db` is a `JiraDatabase` instance wrapped in a reference counting smart pointer so we can share ownership.

The `Navigator` Struct contains 2 primary functions. `get_current_page()` which does exactly what the name suggests and `handle_action()` which responds to user actions.

To complete this step finish all the TODO items in `navigator.rs`.

**NOTE 1:** Use `with_context()` and the `anyhow!` macro form the anyhow crate inside `handle_action()` for error handling.

**NOTE 2:** A method called `as_any()` has been added to all page objects. This was done to support down-casting, which is used in the navigator tests. For more info check out [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33687447/how-to-get-a-reference-to-a-concrete-type-from-a-trait-object).

### Step 2

**The Program Loop**

The program loop will be defined inside `main.rs`. First we will instantiate the navigator. Then inside the program loop we will get the current page, render it, wait for user input and then handle the input.

To complete this task finish the TODO items in `main.rs`.

**NOTE 1:** A new dependency called `clearscreen` has been added. At the top of the program loop we call `clearscreen::clear()`. This will clear the screen which is what we want to do before rendering the new content. Think about it like refreshing a web page... everything is wiped away and reloaded.

**NOTE 2:** A function called `wait_for_key_press()` has been added to `io_utils.rs`. Use this method when displaying errors. For example:

```rust
if let Err(error) = page.draw_page() {
    println!("Error rendering page: {}\nPress any key to continue...", error);
    wait_for_key_press();
};
```

## Manual Tests

Run these manual tests (**_from top to bottom in order_**) to see if your program works as expected.

**NOTE:** Before running these tests, reset the database by updating `data/db.json` to this:

```json
{
  "last_item_id": 0,
  "epics": {},
  "stories": {}
}
```

**Create Epic**

Steps:

- `cd` into the root folder of the project
- Run `cargo run`
- Input `c` to create a new Epic
- Input `"New Epic name"` as Epic name
- Input `"New Epic description"` as Epic description
- Check if `db.json` matches with the following:
  ```json
  {
    "last_item_id": 1,
    "epics": {
      "1": {
        "name": "New Epic name",
        "description": "New Epic description",
        "status": "Open",
        "stories": []
      }
    },
    "stories": {}
  }
  ```

**Create Story**

Steps:

- Input `1` to select the created Epic
- Input `c` to create a new Story in the selected Epic
- Input `"New Story name"` as Story name
- Input `"New Story description"` as Story description
- Check if `db.json` matches with the following:
  ```json
  {
    "last_item_id": 2,
    "epics": {
      "1": {
        "name": "New Epic name",
        "description": "New Epic description",
        "status": "Open",
        "stories": [2]
      }
    },
    "stories": {
      "2": {
        "name": "New Story name",
        "description": "New Story description",
        "status": "Open"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

**Update Epic**

Steps:

- Input `u` to update the selected Epic
- Input `2` to select `IN-PROGRESS` as the updated status
- Check if `db.json` matches with the following:
  ```json
  {
    "last_item_id": 2,
    "epics": {
      "1": {
        "name": "New Epic name",
        "description": "New Epic description",
        "status": "InProgress",
        "stories": [2]
      }
    },
    "stories": {
      "2": {
        "name": "New Story name",
        "description": "New Story description",
        "status": "Open"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

**Update Story**

Steps:

- Input `2` to select the created Story
- Input `u` to update the selected Story
- Input `3` to select `RESOLVED` as the updated status
- Check if `db.json` matches with the following:
  ```json
  {
    "last_item_id": 2,
    "epics": {
      "1": {
        "name": "New Epic name",
        "description": "New Epic description",
        "status": "InProgress",
        "stories": [2]
      }
    },
    "stories": {
      "2": {
        "name": "New Story name",
        "description": "New Story description",
        "status": "Resolved"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

**Remove Story**

Steps:

- Input `d` to delete the selected Story
- Input `Y` to confirm removal
- Check if `db.json` matches with the following:
  ```json
  {
    "last_item_id": 2,
    "epics": {
      "1": {
        "name": "New Epic name",
        "description": "New Epic description",
        "status": "InProgress",
        "stories": []
      }
    },
    "stories": {}
  }
  ```

**Remove Epic**

Steps:

- Input `c` to create a new Story in the selected Epic
- Input `"New Story name"` as Story name
- Input `"New Story description"` as Story description
- Input `d` to delete the selected Epic
- Input `Y` to confirm removal
- Check if storage.json matches with the following:
  ```json
  { "last_item_id": 3, "epics": {}, "stories": {} }
  ```
